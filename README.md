Stuff for my workshop at Data Science Training for Librarians

If you have git, clone this repo on to your machine like this:

    git clone https://github.com/jradavenport/dst4l_2015.git

If you don't have git, or just want a copy of the repo, click on the "[Download ZIP](https://github.com/jradavenport/dst4l_2015/archive/master.zip)" button on the right.

## Notes
 - The IPython notebooks are designed to replicate 3 blog posts from [If We Assume](http://www.ifweassume.com)
 - you will need to unzip the data files (e.g. "batlog_fuji.dat.zip")
 - the Ipython notebooks *should* run as-is, but we'll explore them together and change things
